Hi. I'm a 4th year Computer Science student currently studying at Dalhousie University. This blog was made so I could write about the interesting challenges and projects that I come across during my learning experience. This blog will likely be a combination of side projects + programming problem commentary and whatever else I might feel like writing about.
